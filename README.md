- 👋 Hi, I’m @henrik392 (Henrik Halvorsen Kvamme), currently a student from Norway.
- 👀 I’m interested in app development, game development, web development, UX, vector illustrations (art, icons, logos), making electronic devices (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi, other microcontrollers).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, React, Tailwind CSS, more curcuiting and soldering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate any of the avbove interests, although collaborating with someone who has experience with arts would be ideal.
